React is a client side javascript library to create/build user interface 
it is not a framework , but a library
Focuses only on rich user interfaces
React has a rich ecosystem , and is fully capable of building fully fledged web application
created and maintained by facebook
Can find stackoverflow solutions to different react problems

--------------

React has a component bases architecture
which means that it allows us break down the applications  in small encapulated blocks
example :- Header
           SideNav
           Main content (Body)
           Footer
Components also make it easy to make usable code , for example , if we create a component in react (an article)
we can easily use them in angular / vue javascript

--------------

React is declarative 
This means that we tell react what we want and the react with its react DOM library will build the actual ui
Known as declarative Paradigm
React makes it easy to create complex ui by abstracting the difficult parts 
React handles efficiently the updating and rendering of the components when there are changes
DOM updates are graceful in React

--------------

React native is used for mobile applications

--------------

JavaScript can be used to manipulate DOM (Document Object Model)

--------------

React projects use a build process , that is , we dont declare a script tag inside the html file , but instead everything is done inside the javascript file
